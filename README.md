# Black Hat GraphQL
Book files for **Black Hat GraphQL**.

Enjoy!

***

## Errata
* Page 83 Listing 4-14: `grep` command should be corrected to: `grep -Hnio "graphiql\|graphql-playground" dvga-report/source/*`
* Page 112: The sentence "_In DVGA, run the following query [...]_" should read: "_In **Altair**, run the following query [...]_".
* Page 177: The `COOKIES` variable value should read `{"session":"session-secret"}`

## Notes
* Due to changes in InQL, you may need to install the tool from the its V4 branch (4.0.7)[https://github.com/doyensec/inql/releases/tag/v4.0.7]
